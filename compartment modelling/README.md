# ðŸ§ª Assignment 5: Compartment Modelling

This folder contains the solution for Assignment 5 of the BM2102 module, focusing on compartmental physiological systems modeled using **MATLAB** and **Simulink**. The assignment covers thyroid hormone dynamics (Riggs model) and glucose-insulin dynamics (Bolieâ€™s model), including disease states such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, goitre, tumors, and glucagon effects.

## Biological Context

- **Riggs Model (Thyroid Hormone Dynamics)**  
  Models iodine metabolism involving iodine, gland, and hormone compartments, simulating normal physiology and pathological conditions like autoimmune hypothyroidism, low iodine intake, Graveâ€™s disease, goitre, and tumors.

- **Glucose-Insulin Model (Bolieâ€™s Model)**  
  Models plasma glucose and insulin dynamics in response to various inputs, including normal, diabetic, and glucagon-extended states.
