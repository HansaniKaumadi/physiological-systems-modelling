# ü´Å Respiratory Mechanics Simulation Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of respiratory mechanics using a simulation tool developed by **David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento** and **Daniela Acevedo Guerrero (2020)**. The tool enables users to study various adult respiratory conditions such as **normal**, **restrictive**, and **obstructive pulmonary diseases**. The simulator visualizes ventilation patterns and supports the comparison of **minute ventilation** under different physiological and pathological settings.

## üìñ Introduction

This analysis aims to explore how different respiratory pathologies affect mechanical ventilation. By simulating normal lung function and disease states (restrictive and obstructive), we examine variations in:

- **Lung compliance and resistance**
- **Tidal volume and minute ventilation**
- **Ventilation pattern visualizations**

These insights help deepen our understanding of how respiratory mechanics change across clinical conditions ‚Äî an important step toward effective ventilator management in healthcare.

## üß∞ Simulation Tool

The simulation is conducted using a **GUI-based Simulink application**:

- **Developed by**: David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero
- **Platform**: MATLAB Simulink with GUI integration
- **Functionality**: 
  - Simulates lung behavior under normal, restrictive, and obstructive conditions
  - Provides graphical plots of respiratory parameters (pressure, flow, volume)
  - Allows adjustment of compliance, resistance, and ventilator settings

## üìä Simulation Scenarios & Results

| Condition     | Lung Compliance | Airway Resistance | Peak Pressure | BPM | Minute Ventilation (approx.) |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|-----|-------------------------------|
| Normal        | 0.1 L/cmH‚ÇÇO      | 0.8 cmH‚ÇÇO/L/s      | 10 cmH‚ÇÇO       | 10  | 5.0 L/min                     |
| Obstructive   | 0.2 L/cmH‚ÇÇO      | 1.9 cmH‚ÇÇO/L/s      | 12 cmH‚ÇÇO       | 10  | 4.2 L/min                     |
| Restrictive   | 0.05 L/cmH‚ÇÇO     | 0.8 cmH‚ÇÇO/L/s      | 16 cmH‚ÇÇO       | 10  | 3.2 L/min                     |

### ‚úÖ Observations:
- **Restrictive disease**: Decreased lung compliance ‚Üí lower tidal volume ‚Üí reduced minute ventilation.
- **Obstructive disease**: Increased resistance ‚Üí limited airflow during inspiration ‚Üí air trapping ‚Üí lower effective ventilation.

All simulation outputs including **graphs and screenshots** are stored in the `/graphs` folder.
