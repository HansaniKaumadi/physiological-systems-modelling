# ðŸŒ¿ Branched Cylinders â€“ Dendritic Tree Approximation

This repository contains an analytical and simulation-based study of **branched cylindrical models** representing dendritic trees in neurons. The work explores steady-state solutions of the cable equation applied to simplified neuronal geometries, focusing on first-order branching under various boundary conditions.

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This assignment aims to approximate the **electrical behavior of dendritic trees** using simplified cable models consisting of a parent branch and two daughter branches. It investigates how voltage profiles change with electrotonic distance and under different physiological boundary conditions.

Key objectives include:

- Solving the cable equation using electrotonic distances.
- Applying boundary and nodal conditions to build a system of equations.
- Using MATLAB to solve and visualize voltage distributions.
- Evaluating different terminal conditions (sealed-end, short-circuit, etc.).

The model is based on the **Rall equivalent cylinder theory**, where the dendritic structure is simplified into one parent and two daughter branches, each defined by its **electrotonic length** and **diameter**.

## âœ… Observations

- Voltage attenuates with electrotonic distance more significantly in **sealed-end conditions**.
- The **boundary conditions** strongly affect the terminal potential, highlighting the importance of nodal analysis.
- Consistent branching rules (e.g., diameter ratios) maintain continuous voltage and current flow.
