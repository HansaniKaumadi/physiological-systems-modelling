# Properties of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and simulation results for exploring key electrophysiological properties of neurons using the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The work was carried out as part of the module **BM2102 Modelling and Analysis of Physiological Systems**.

## ðŸ“– Overview

The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a mathematical framework describing the ionic mechanisms underlying action potential generation in neurons. This assignment investigates:  

- **Threshold behavior**  
- **Refractoriness** (absolute and relative refractory periods)  
- **Repetitive firing** in response to sustained stimuli  
- **Temperature dependence** of neuronal excitability  

Simulations were performed using MATLAB to analyze these properties under space-clamp conditions.
