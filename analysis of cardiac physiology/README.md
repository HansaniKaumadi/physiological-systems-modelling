# ü´Ä Analysis of Cardiac Physiology


This project presents a detailed analysis of cardiac physiology under two specific conditions:  
1. **Normal cardiac rhythm**  
2. **Cardiac rhythm in the presence of aortic valve stenosis**

A single cardiac cycle in the human heart consists of three key phases: **atrial systole**, **ventricular systole**, and **complete cardiac diastole**. These phases are characterized by dynamic changes in physiological parameters such as chamber pressures, volumes, and valve function. These changes were visualized and interpreted using tools like the *Wigger‚Äôs Diagram*, which integrates electrical, mechanical, and acoustic events of the cardiac cycle. The simulations were performed using the  [CircAdapt Simulator (v1.1.0)](https://www.circadapt.org/), an interactive cardiovascular simulation platform capable of modeling pressure, volume, and flow relationships in a real-time heart model.

The analysis involved observing and analyzing multiple cardiac parameters, including:  

- **Pressure vs. Time** plots for the left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta  
- **Volume vs. Time** plots for the left ventricle  
- **Flow velocities** for the aortic and mitral valves  
- **Pressure-Volume (P-V) loops** for the left ventricle  

The **REFERENCE mode** in CircAdapt was utilized to clearly identify the opening and closing events of the heart valves. To simulate aortic valve stenosis, the **valve stenosis percentage parameter** in the simulator was adjusted accordingly. Observations included:  

- Timing of valve opening and closing  
- Labeling of phases on the P-V loop  
- Flow velocity profiles for both valves  
- Pressure differences between chambers and vessels  

This analysis highlights how cardiovascular dynamics are altered under normal and pathological conditions.
