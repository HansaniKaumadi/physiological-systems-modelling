# ü´Ä Analysis of Cardiac Physiology

This repository contains the assignment **‚ÄúAnalysis of Cardiac Physiology‚Äù** completed as part of the *Physiological Systems Modelling* module. The simulations were performed using [CircAdapt](https://www.circadapt.org/) ‚Äì a cardiovascular system simulation tool ‚Äì and include a comprehensive study of cardiac dynamics under both normal and pathological conditions.
